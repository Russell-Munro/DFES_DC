# After installing this package, be sure to Register the DataConnectorUIHandler HttpHandler in the Web.Config of the Sitefinity Instance:

<httpHandlers>
	<add verb="*" path="/Sitefinity/DataConnectorUI.axd" type="UDC.SitefinityContextPlugin.Handlers.DataConnectorUIHandler, UDC.SitefinityContextPlugin" />
</httpHandlers>

<handlers>

# On the first Execution of the Sitefinity Instance after this package has been installed, two new Roles will be Created which will be used in the UniversalDataConnector Admin Application UI. These roles are called: "DataConnector_Administrator", and "DataConnector_SyncManager" respectively. Add your desired Users to these roles to control level of access to the Data Connector.
# Configuration Settings will also be available to configure the URL of the Self Contained Data Connector UI Application, as well as the Privilaged API User Account that will be leveraged for SF API Functions from the Data Connector.
